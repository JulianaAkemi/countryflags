# Countries API Project - Akemi

## Trainee Front-End Development Project (React)

In this challenge, I was provided with an API and the following(below) instructions and style guide. This project was developed by me with the mentoring of a veteran work colleague (thank you so much, Lucas!!!). We aimed exercising the use of git in a professional capacity, according with a project's specific flow and documentation, more than that, the development of generic components and a grid system were my favorite parts.

Made with:
- React
- Styled Components
- Axios
- React Router v6

See the project live here: https://country-flags-api.herokuapp.com/

# Instructions
## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with our [Countries API](https://wtt-countries.herokuapp.com/) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use [React](https://reactjs.org) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org). You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode 
- Persist the active color scheme theme using localStorage (optional)

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project using the following designs on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/apS9eYkXKdv8br0G4r0rUt/Front-End-Test-01-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1).


In this challenge, you will find mobile and desktop designs in light and dark mode color schemes for both pages.

There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [Countries API](https://wtt-countries.herokuapp.com/) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

There is a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

**Good luck!** ðŸš€
